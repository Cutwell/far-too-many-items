# Far too many items
A ridiculous amount of new items for Minecraft. 

### How many is too many?
We have taken a subset of Minecraft items for this version 1.0 release. Over ~300 items can be combined with ~200 "modifier" items, to produce over 60,000 new items for Minecraft!

### A terrible aesthetic
In version 1.0, new items behave the same as their base, with only aesthetic customisations. See FUTURE.md for a preview into version 2.0, with unique item effects!

Ever wanted a carrot diamond sword? Or a porkchop diamond helmet? This mod allows you to combine _almost_ any two items you can get your hands upon, to create adorable (or monstrous) combinations. 

# Sixty THOUSAND items!
---

That's right, not 100, not 1,000, but 60,000+ new items for Minecraft. All with procedurally generated textures!


### Procedurally generating an army of items
60,000 unique items are just too many to draw by hand, so instead we turned to procedural generation and scripting to generate items.
The process is simple - take an item, extract its colour palette, then use it to colour the ~200 possible items it could be combined with!
