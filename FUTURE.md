# Far too many items
A ridiculous amount of new items for Minecraft. 

### How many items are there in Minecraft?
There are [1004](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fi068o/how_many_obtainable_items_are_in_minecraft_as_of/fwjcj0b) (obtainable) items in Minecraft, as of 1.16. This is clearly far too few.

### How many items should there be?
Ever wanted a carrot diamond sword? Or a porkchop diamond helmet? This mod allows you to combine _any_ two items you can get your hands upon, to create adorable (or monstrous) combinations. 

# One MILLION eight THOUSAND and SIXTEEN

That's right, not 100, not 1,000, but 1,000,000+ new items for Minecraft. All with procedurally generated textures and effects!


### Procedurally generating an army of items
1,008,016 unique items are just too many to draw by hand, so instead we turned to procedural generation and scripting to generate items.
The process is simple - take an item, extract its colour palette, then use it to colour the 1004 possible items it could be combined with!

### Item effects
Each of the 1004 base items imbue their combined item with some unique attribute. For instance an experience bottle grants [3 to 11](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bottle_o%27_Enchanting#Usage) (average 7.0) experience points, and combining one with a diamond helmet might permanently boost the experience obtained from smashing bottles by a few points while worn.

### Balancing
Of course, procedurally generating item effects will result in some combinations being more advantageous than others. Combining fire charges with a steak might set you on fire when you eat it, while combining a rare enchanted golden apple with a piece of armour might give a permanent health boost. Instead of a balancing flaw, this should be seen as a charming feature of this mod, especially considering that there are other a million unique interactions coded. 

### Useless items
Not all items can be consumed or worn. Items such as the heart of the sea are used purely as crafting items, with no other uses or effects upon the game. However they are not without merit when used correctly. Combining a heart of the sea with a carrot might give you a 'carrot heart of the sea', which while beautifully orange, will not have any real use, while combining a heart of the sea with a carrot might give you a 'heart of the sea carrot', which could grant the [Conduit Power](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Conduit_Power) effect for a short time after eating.
